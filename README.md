### Hey, I am Simran Gandhi ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in information technology. Being an IT student, I have a great inclination towards different computer technologies. I have learnt few computer languages like Python, C and C++.  I am specifically attracted towards machine learning, data science as well as artificial intelligence, and am working towards increasing my skills on the same. Along with my technical skills I have a creative side to me as well. I understand that it is important to balance my time between my studies, acquiring technical knowledge and pursuing my passion. I am constantly motivated to achieve my goals and look forward to achieving them with complete sincerity and hard work.
